Wearing his newly created <a href="">hat</a>, Henry hurried home through the hustle and bustle of the city. He got a lot of funny looks because of the <em>'greenbeanie' </em>on his head, but he didn't mind and he smiled at everyone. Yes, it was a bit unusual, all green and fitted, but what made it so incredible was the most marvelous little tree on top.  He really liked wearing it, but especially today, the day of the big wilderness adventure!
